I speak Chinese and English. When I see an article worth sharing, I translate it so more people can read it.

I code. It's easier to speak to a computer than a human being because every computer language has a set of explict rules and human beings don't. And I don't feel guilty to order a computer to execute repetitive tasks.

I teach. Teaching is a way to show off what I know and if it happens to help someone, it's one stone two birds.

And, I try to love.
